# Work with RESTful API 

In this solution, we use different classes to manage the flow from receiving an HTTP request to sending a response. The process begins with the Controller class, which handles each HTTP request and passes it to the Service class. The Service class, in turn, interacts with the DatabaseService class, which is solely responsible for reading and writing data to the file. Once the necessary operation is performed, the result is propagated back up through the layers, ending with the Controller sending the response.

The Model classes represent the data structures in our application. We have three primary models: WasteType, WasteReport, and Person. These models are used to map data between the database and the application, ensuring smooth data exchange in both directions.

To ensure the correctness of the data, various validation methods are applied throughout the process, preventing invalid data from entering the system.

Additionally, Converter classes were implemented to simplify the JSON serialization and deserialization of the Person model, which starts as an interface (IPerson) and branches into two concrete classes: Employee and Manager. Since data for both is currently stored together, the Converter ensures that during serialization and deserialization, the interface is properly mapped to the corresponding class based on specific fields.
