## ProjectDomain

The projectfocuses on developing an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)Improvement Platform, designed to help businesses enhance their sustainability efforts, governance practices, and social responsibility.

**Why this domain?**

With increasing global emphasis on corporate responsibility and sustainability, ESG metrics have become a critical factor in determining a company’s long-term success and appeal to investors. Many businesses struggle with how to assess and improve their ESG performance effectively. By developing a comprehensive platform in this domain, we aim to provide companies with tools to conduct ESG audits, set measurable goals, track performance, and engage stakeholders—all in a single solution.

We chose this domain because it directly contributes to creating a positive environmental and social impact while also addressing governance issues. As companies are increasingly held accountable for their ESG practices, there’s a growing demand for tools that simplify and streamline this process. The platform will not only help businesses stay compliant with ESG regulations but also improve their public image and attract more socially conscious investors.

## Requirements(User Stories)

1. **As a sustainability manager,** I want to set waste reduction targets based on current waste production so that we can align our efforts with our company's environmental goals.

2. **As an operations manager,** I want to receive alerts when waste exceeds a certain threshold so that immediate action can be taken to mitigate excess waste production.

3. **As a procurement officer,** I want to track and report on the lifecycle of products and materials so that we can prioritize sustainable materials and suppliers.

4. **As a company executive,** I want to view visual dashboards on our waste management performance so that I can assess how well we are meeting our ESG targets.
