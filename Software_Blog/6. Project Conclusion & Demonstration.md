## Final Development Update

Over the course of the project, our team successfully developed and finalized the **Comprehensive ESG Enhancement Platform**, aimed at improving waste management and sustainability reporting. Here's an overview of what was achieved during the development process:

1. **Backend Infrastructure**:
    
   - Transitioned from JSON file storage to SQLite with Entity Framework Core, significantly improving efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.
        
   - Implemented a robust RESTful API for waste report and user management, following best practices such as resource orientation, statelessness, and standard response codes​.
        
2. **Frontend Development**:
    
   - Designed a Blazor Server-based web application with features including waste report management, analytics, and sustainability goal tracking.
        
   - Created an intuitive user interface with role-based access control, ensuring employees and managers can access features relevant to their roles.
        
3. **User Management**:
    
   - Integrated secure login and registration functionalities using password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT-based authentication.
        
   - Developed features for role-based access control, enabling managers to manage users and waste reports effectively.
        
4. **Waste Report Analytics**:
    
   - Enabled users to add, edit, delete, and view waste reports, with visualizations displaying waste management performance over time.
        
5. **Data Access**:
    
   - Leveraged LINQ for querying SQLite, replacing manual SQL queries, enhancing readability, and reducing the risk of runtime errors.
        
6. **Sustainability Goals**:
    
   - Provided tools for users to set and track waste reduction goals in alignment with company ESG objectives​.

## Summary of Project Outcome

The project achieved its objectives by delivering a comprehensive platform for waste management and sustainability reporting. Key outcomes include:

   - **Enhanced Efficiency**: Transitioning to SQLite streamlined data management and improved query performance.
    
   - **User-Centric Design**: The Blazor interface ensures ease of use and customization based on user roles.
    
   - **Security and Reliability**: Implementing JWT and secure password storage enhanced system security.
    
   - **Analytics and Reporting**: The platform offers detailed waste analytics and reports, helping businesses track progress and meet ESG goals.
    
These features make the platform a valuable tool for businesses aiming to enhance their sustainability efforts and improve operational efficiency.

## Updated Requirements List

Below is a summary of the initial requirements and their implementation status:

| Requirement                                               | Status        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Users can set waste reduction goals                   | ❌ Not Implemented |
| Users can manage employees in the system              | ✅ Implemented |
| Users can view waste management performance reports   | ✅ Implemented |
| Users can track waste reduction progress over time    | ✅ Implemented |
| Users can report waste generated by their department  | ✅ Implemented |



## Conclusion
While the feature for setting waste reduction goals remains unimplemented, the project successfully delivered all other initial requirements and added a recycling tips page to assist employees in better sorting waste in Salling Group's warehouses. Additionally, the platform provides significant value through role-based access control, improved data management techniques, and enhanced security measures. The system is well-positioned to assist businesses in improving their sustainability practices, monitoring waste management efforts, and complying with ESG standards.
