## Project Domain

The project focuses on developing an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Improvement Platform, designed to help businesses enhance their sustainability efforts, governance practices, and social responsibility.

### Why this domain?

With increasing global emphasis on corporate responsibility and sustainability, ESG metrics have become a critical factor in determining a company’s long-term success and appeal to investors. Many businesses struggle to assess and improve their ESG performance effectively. By developing a comprehensive platform in this domain, we aim to provide companies with tools to conduct ESG audits, set measurable goals, track performance, and engage stakeholders — all within a single solution.

We chose this domain because it directly contributes to creating positive environmental and social impact while also addressing governance challenges. As companies are increasingly held accountable for their ESG practices, there’s a growing demand for tools that simplify and streamline this process. The platform will not only help businesses stay compliant with ESG regulations but also improve their public image and attract socially conscious investors.
