### **Workflow**

1.  **Add Migration**
- Use ```dotnet ef migrations add``` to create a migration file that reflects the changes in your model classes.dotnet ef migrations add AddNewColumnToWasteReportThis generates a migration file that adds a column to the WasteReports table.
        
2.  **Apply Migration**
- Use ```dotnet ef database update``` to apply the migration to the database.
- Example:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddNewColumnToWasteReport
```
This updates the database schema to match your models and runs the SQL commands defined in the Up() method of the migration.
        
3.  **Rollback Migration**
```bash
dotnet ef database update <PreviousMigrationName>
```
This applies the Down() method from the migration you want to undo.

### **Current Migrations**

*   20241118112600\_InitialCreate.cs: This is the first migration. It creates the initial database schema, including the People, WasteReports, Employees, and Managers tables.
    
*   AppDbContextModelSnapshot.cs: This is the snapshot of the current model structure, used by EF Core to detect changes for future migrations.
