## **Introduction**
Modern applications rely heavily on efficient and maintainable data access. Traditionally, interacting with databases involved direct SQL queries. However, with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like Entity Framework (EF) Core, the way developers interact with data has evolved significantly. This document explores how the introduction of ORM changes data handling, how LINQ differs from traditional SQL, and provides examples based on the SQLite integration in our project.

## **1. How ORM Changes Data Access in the System**

### **1.1 Traditional Approach**
Before introducing ORM, data access in our system relied on manually crafted SQL queries or file-based operations. For example, our previous implementation used JSON files stored locally to manage entities like waste reports and users. Data manipulation required:
- Reading the file into memory.
- Applying changes programmatically.
- Writing the modified data back to disk.

This approach was limited by:
- Lack of consistency enforcement (e.g., data constraints).
- Difficulty in managing relationships and complex queries.
- High error-proneness due to reliance on manual serialization and deserialization.

### **1.2 With ORM**
Entity Framework Core, an ORM, simplifies data access by abstracting database interactions into object-oriented operations. Key changes include:

1. **Database Context**:
   - The `AppDbContext` acts as a central hub for accessing database entities.
   - It manages entity tracking, database connections, and schema configurations.

2. **Entities as Models**:
   - Data is represented as classes (e.g., `WasteReport` and `Person`), which align closely with database tables.
   - Relationships and constraints are defined using attributes or fluent APIs.

3. **CRUD Operations**:
   - ORM automates CRUD operations, reducing boilerplate code and the risk of SQL injection.
   - Developers focus on business logic rather than crafting queries.

4. **Migrations**:
   - Changes to the schema are handled via migrations, ensuring database consistency and version control.

## **2. LINQ vs. Traditional SQL**

### **2.1 Traditional SQL Approach**
In traditional SQL, developers interact with the database using raw queries. For example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM WasteReports WHERE IsActive = 1;
```

The above query requires:
   - Explicit connection handling (e.g., opening/closing the connection).
   - Manual parameter handling to avoid SQL injection.

**Code Example** (Traditional SQL in C#):
```csharp
using (var connection = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=app.db"))
{
    connection.Open();
    var command = new SQLiteCommand("SELECT * FROM WasteReports WHERE IsActive = 1", connection);
    var reader = command.ExecuteReader();

    while (reader.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{reader["Id"]}, {reader["WasteType"]}, {reader["WasteAmount"]}");
    }
}
```

### **2.2 LINQ Approach**
With LINQ (Language Integrated Query), queries are written in C# syntax and translated to SQL by the ORM. Example:
```csharp
var activeWasteReports = _context.WasteReports.Where(r => r.IsActive).ToList();
```

**Advantages:**
   - Type Safety: LINQ queries are checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
   - Readability: Queries are concise and align with object-oriented principles.
   - Maintainability: Changes to the schema are reflected in the models, simplifying updates.

**Code Example** (Using LINQ in EF Core):
```csharp
var activeReports = await _context.WasteReports
    .Where(report => report.IsActive)
    .OrderBy(report => report.WasteDate)
    .ToListAsync();

foreach (var report in activeReports)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{report.Id}, {report.WasteType}, {report.WasteAmount}");
}
```

## **3. Key Differences Between LINQ and Traditional SQL**

| **Aspect**           | **Traditional SQL**                          | **LINQ (via ORM)**                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Query Language**    | SQL strings in the codebase.                | Integrated into C# with strong typing.   |
| **Error Checking**    | Runtime errors from invalid queries.        | Compile-time validation for queries.     |
| **Data Mapping**      | Manual mapping between rows and objects.    | Automatic mapping via ORM models.        |
| **Relationships**     | Requires JOINs and foreign key logic.       | Simplified navigation via properties.    |
| **Database Changes**  | Requires manual updates to queries.         | Schema changes reflected in models.      |

## **4. Practical Examples from Our Project**

### **4.1 Registration Example**

**Traditional JSON-Based Approach (Before implementing SQLite):**
```csharp
var people = await _databaseService.ReadDBAsync();
people.Add(JObject.FromObject(newPerson));
await _databaseService.WriteDBAsync(people);
```

**With EF Core:**
```csharp
await _context.People.AddAsync(newPerson);
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

### **4.2 Fetching Active Waste Reports**

**Traditional SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM WasteReports WHERE IsActive = 1;
```

**With LINQ:**
```csharp
var activeReports = _context.WasteReports.Where(r => r.IsActive).ToList();
```

### **4.3 Updating a Waste Report**

**Traditional SQL:**
```sql
UPDATE WasteReports SET WasteAmount = 500 WHERE Id = 1;
```

**With LINQ:**
```csharp
var report = await _context.WasteReports.FindAsync(1);
if (report != null)
{
    report.WasteAmount = 500;
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

## **5. Summary**
The integration of an ORM like EF Core with SQLite has transformed how we manage data in our system by:

   - Streamlining data access and reducing boilerplate code.
   - Enhancing maintainability through type safety and LINQ integration.
   - Abstracting database complexities, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

This shift enables the system to be more scalable, reliable, and easier to maintain while ensuring a better developer experience.

## **Appendix: Workflow**
In this project we use ```Migrations```.

#### **Why Use Migrations**
   - **Version Control for the Database:** Track schema changes over time, just like we track code changes.
   - **Database Evolution:** Incrementally update the database schema as the application grows.
   - **Consistency:** Ensure all developers and environments (e.g., local, staging, production) use the same database schema.

#### **What Migrations Do**
1. Synchronize Code with the Database
   - Migrations translate changes in the application's model classes (e.g., Person, WasteReport) into database schema changes (tables, columns, relationships).

2. Track Database Changes
   - Migrations track incremental changes to the database schema over time, making it easier to apply updates as the models evolve.

3. Generate SQL Commands
   - EF Core generates SQL commands based on the models, which can then be used to create, update, or delete tables, columns, indexes, and more in the database.

4. Maintain a History
   - EF Core keeps track of which migrations have already been applied to the database, preventing duplicate or conflicting schema changes.

### **6.1 Add Migration**
   - Use ```dotnet ef migrations add``` to create a migration file that reflects the changes in the model classes.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddNewColumnToWasteReport
```
This generates a migration file that adds a column to the ```WasteReports``` table.

### **6.2 Apply Migration**
   - Use ```dotnet ef database update``` to apply the migration to the database.

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```
This updates the database schema to match the models and runs the SQL commands defined in the ```Up()``` method of the migration.

### **6.3 Rollback Migration**
   - To rollback a migration, use:

```bash
dotnet ef database update <PreviousMigrationName>
```
This applies the ```Down()``` method from the migration that we want to undo.

### **6.4 Initial Migrations (Consider as an Example)**
   - **20241118112600_InitialCreate.cs:** This is the first migration. It creates the initial database schema, including the ```People```, ```WasteReports```, ```Employees```, and ```Managers``` tables.
   - **AppDbContextModelSnapshot.cs:** This is the snapshot of the current model structure, used by EF Core to detect changes for future migrations.
